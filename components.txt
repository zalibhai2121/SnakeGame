#software architecture 
	- take an idea take it apart and how it works and use code to actually implement the code
	- python: data science
	- how do i take the problem, define its behavior and understand how it works and put it in code
	- object-oriented programming


# 4 big things that we need to go over
	- Think of the behavior
	- COnstants -- one file where you can change becomes easier
		- Window dimensions
		- size of cells
		- color
		- frame rate -- tie the speed of the game with the frame 
		- cell width and height
	- Data defintions
		- moving lots of data and using it to draw it to the screen. 
		- working and manipulating the data and drawing it to show it to the user
		- what is a snake game, what makes it a snake game. 
		- array of length of snake
		- apple: in a cell, doesnt move,but gets eaten
			x and y coordinate
	- go over functions
# Snake:
	- blocks
	-x-y coordinate 
	- entire snake is that
	- list of blocks
	- y-zero is at the top
	- dictionary [{"x":1, "y":2 }, {"x": snake[0].x - 1, }]

# What are the rules of the game 
	- what are the behaviors 
		- Game over state:
			- snake hits the edge of the screen
			- if the snake touches itself
	- Snake Movement:
		- body trails its head
	-Snake:
		- Eats an apple, grows by one 
	-Score:
		- How much food has been eaten
	Menu Screen:
		- Shows one time at the beginning
		- Disappears on any key press

	Gameo Over screen:
		- displays when snake hits wall or eats itself
		- will go to new game with any key press
	Key input:
		- arrow keys and wasd change snake direction
